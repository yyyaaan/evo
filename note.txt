1. What is the research question? The intro operates on a very general level and mentions many interesting things. However, it is unclear what the focus of this study is, what the research question is and how you aim at answering that research question.

2. The literature review is also on a very general level. First decide in the research question and then make the lit section more focused and deeper.

3. How was the data collected? From where? How were they analysed? What challenges were met in the process? How were they tackled?

4. It is very hard to see the connection between your data and your findings. A lot of the stuff in sections 4 and 5 would fit better into the lit review. Overall, you should make better use of your data set because it is impressive in its size and level of detail.

The main message is that you should make the thesis more focused and report more thoroughly what exactly you have done.

I hope this helps!
